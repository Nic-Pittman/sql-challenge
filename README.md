SQL Homework - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

SQL Homework - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts


Background
It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.
In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:


Data Engineering


Data Analysis


Data Modeling
Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables.
